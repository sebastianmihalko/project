<h3> Home </h3>

<p>This is the finished product of my Senior Project and it illustrates through the Timeline the steps that I took to create this site starting in New York and continuing it here in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>You can visit Jekyll and GitHub and see if you can start up your very own website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" alt="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.github.com" alt="GitHub">GitHub</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Enjoy the Site!

<p>I have also made a Google Slides with a more in depth look at the process:</p>

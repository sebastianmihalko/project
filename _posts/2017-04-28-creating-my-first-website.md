After about 2 weeks of focusing on school work and baseball, I made the decision to start my own website from scratch and see how I can do with just using the basics. First I had no idea where to begin, but after asking my brother some tough questions he pointed me out to Thomas Bradley who was a web developer that makes YouTube videos. Thomas Bradley fortunately has also made videos on how to work jekyll and making a site using Jekyll and GitHub.

Since I have been following him I have been able to come up with the homescreen and I will hopefully be able to put the pictures I have captured from New York and the screenshots showing my progress throughout the project.

Even though I have 3 years of coding experience I still had a tough time understanding and using Jekyll throughout my time at Partner & Partners. I was really set out on my own with little help because my brothers had their company to run and deadlines to meet. I first decided to explore how Jekyll works and get an understanding of how it operates and learning the basics of the root languages involved in Jekyll, such as HTML and GitHub Markdown.
After about 2 hours of learning the code I started to experiment with the changes to the theme and some of rudimentary things I could do to the site like linking a website inside of a blog post as you saw in the first post where I linked the Jekyll main site. Then I started to explore the [Docs][jekyll-site-docs] where there are step by step instructions to Getting Started and meddling with the Configurations, or just Basic Usage. In the [Configuration][jekyll-site-docs-config] you can use the functions that they give you in the `_config.yml` to play around with functions such as Time Zone or Local Server Port. All of those functions help to build up the bulk of the site and keep the security of it up to snuff.
After lunch Zach helped me get all my folders and things in the right area and set me up with a better text editor called [Atom][atom-site], which is made with Github and is what I am using to edit my site right now. After this it was time for us to leave the office. Thus, my second day at Partner and Partners was over.

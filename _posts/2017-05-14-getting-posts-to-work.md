Since I last posted in April I have made some great leaps and bounds while following Thomas Bradley. I have made a Navigation bar that you see under the title Senior Project 2017 that links to the Timeline page where you can see my posts like this one. The posts outline my time in New York and at home with this project, and they also come with the pictures.

I also made links to the posts in different categories. So that the posts that I made in New York were in a "In New York" sub-navigation and the posts I made at home were in a "At Home" sub-navigation. This makes the site overall more organized and creates less clutter on the timeline page.

After completing the Timeline page I felt that I had done enough for the day and the last things I needed to do was just spruce up the header and home page to make it a little more active.

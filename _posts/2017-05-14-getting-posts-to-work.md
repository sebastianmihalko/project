Since I last posted in April I have made some great leaps and bounds while following Thomas Bradley. I have made a Navigation bar that you see under the title Senior Project 2017 that links to the Timeline page where you can see my posts like this one. The posts outline my time in New York and at home with this project, and they also come with the pictures.

For further progress on the project you can go to my GitHub https://github.com/sebastianmihalko to see a more detailed timeline of my progress on this project and a change log of the site as well.

It has been a joy working on this project and it gave me new insight into the world of Web Development. This showed me that Web Development is exciting and definitely something I would like to pursue in the future. Thank you for your time.

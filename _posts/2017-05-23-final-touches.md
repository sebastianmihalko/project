To make the home-screen look more lively I took a sample picture from Google Images and added a new masthead class to the common.css file so that I could include this in my header to make it look a lot better. I also moved the navigation below the header so that you could see it a little clearer. I added links to both GitHub and Jekyll encouraging anyone who visits to check it out and see if they can create their own static site using Jekyll and hosting it on GitHub.

For further progress on the project you can go to my GitHub Repository at https://github.com/sebastianmihalko. This repository is basically a change log or more detailed step-by-step procedure on this project

It has been a joy working on this project and it gave me new insight into the world of Web Development. This showed me that Web Development is exciting and definitely something I would like to pursue in the future. Thank you for your time.

Arriving at Partner & Partners, I immediately saw how focused everyone was on one task. I felt a little out of the loop, but after about an hour talking to my brothers Greg and Zach they told me what they wanted me to complete in my time as an intern here at Partner & Partners. They showed me [Jekyll][jekyll-site], which is a platform that transforms plain text files into static websites and blogs. We ran into some trouble installing it onto my computer but after a few minutes of troubleshooting we were able to get it up and running on my computer. That ended my first day at Partner & Partners.

Since this was my last day in the office I really focused on being prepared to work outside the office and knowing as much as possible about Jekyll and Atom and such, so most of my day was just asking Greg and Zach questions abotu those things. I got some concrete answers and a good path as to what they want me to turn the site into and I believe that is what I will eventually do. However, I feel that to better display the information I should keep it in a blog format and update this as we move along with the site continuing through May and hopefully having the site looking pretty for presentation day. I have high hopes for the road ahead and I am sure that I will have questions in the future regarding the site that I will have to consult Greg and Zach about.

It is unfortunate that we were not able to help out with the Interference Archive and justseeds.org to coordinate another event, but I was able to help Zach out with some small thing on the new site that they are working on called [Housing Court Answers][housing-court-answers]. This project, that they completed not too long after I returned to Pittsburgh, is a helpful tool to those who are tenants living anywhere around the Manhattan area. It is a great help to all tenants of the New York/Manhattan Area and it was a very new and interesting project that I was happy to be apart of.

Hopefully this will paint a good picture of what my time spent at Partner and Partners was like. I got the experience of working at a graphic design firm and I now have a better feeling about what I am going to be doing in the future and look forward to it.
